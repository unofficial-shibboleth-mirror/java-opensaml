/**
 * Supports decryption of XMLObjects which represent data encrypted according to the XML Encryption specification,
 * version 20021210.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Details on the components specified as constructor options are as follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>
 * <code>newResolver</code>: This {@link KeyInfoCredentialResolver} instance is used to resolve keys (as Credentials)
 * based on the KeyInfo of EncryptedData elements. While it could in theory be used to handle the complete process of 
 * resolving the data decryption key, including decrypting any necessary EncryptedKey's, it would typically
 * be used in cases where encrypted key transport via an EncryptedKey is not being employed. 
 * This corresponds to scenarios where decryption is instead based on resolving the (presumably shared secret)
 * symmetric data decryption key directly, based on either context or information present in the 
 * EncryptedData's KeyInfo. In cases where the data decryption key is to be resolved by decrypting an EncryptedKey,
 * this resolver would typically not be used and may be <code>null</code>.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * <code>newKEKResolver</code>: This {@link KeyInfoCredentialResolver} instance is used to resolve keys (as Credentials)
 * used to decrypt EncryptedKey elements, based on the KeyInfo information contained within the EncryptedKey element 
 * (also known as a Key Encryption Key or KEK). For asymmetric key transport of encrypted keys, this would entail 
 * resolving the private key which corresponds to the public key which was used to encrypt the EncryptedKey.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * <code>newEncKeyResolver</code>: This {@link EncryptedKeyResolver} instance is responsible for resolving
 * the EncryptedKey element(s) which hold(s) the encrypted data decryption key which would be used to
 * decrypt an EncryptedData element. 
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * XML Encryption can encrypt either a single {@link Element} or the contents of an Element. The caller of this class
 * must select the decryption method which is most appropriate for their specific use case.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the type of plaintext data contained by an {@link EncryptedData} can be checked prior to decryption by
 * examining that element's <code>type</code> attribute ({@link EncryptedData#getType}). This (optional) attribute
 * may contain one of the following two constant values to aid in the decryption process:
 * {@link EncryptionConstants#TYPE_ELEMENT} or {@link EncryptionConstants#TYPE_CONTENT}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By nature the fundamental output of XML decryption is a DOM {@link DocumentFragment} with 1 or more immediate
 * top-level DOM {@link Node} children. This case is reflected in the method {@link #decryptDataToDOM(EncryptedData)}.
 * It is up to the caller to properly process the DOM Nodes which are the children of this document fragment. The
 * DocumentFragment and its Node children will be owned by the DOM {@link Document} which owned the original
 * EncryptedData before decryption. Note, however, that the Node children will not be a part of the tree of Nodes rooted
 * at that Document's document element.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A typical use case will be that the content which was encrypted contained solely {@link Element} nodes. For this use
 * case a convenience method is provided as {@link #decryptDataToList(EncryptedData)}, which returns a list of
 * {@link XMLObject}'s which are the result of unmarshalling each of the child Elements of the decrypted
 * DocumentFragment.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Another typical use case is that the content which was encrypted was a single Element. For this use case a
 * convenience method is provided as {@link #decryptData(EncryptedData)}, which returns a single XMLObject which was
 * the result of unmarshalling this decrypted Element.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In both of these cases the underlying DOM Element which is represented by each of the returned XMLObjects will be
 * owned by the DOM Document which also owns the original EncrytpedData Element. However, note that these cached DOM
 * Elements are <strong>not</strong> part of the tree of Nodes rooted at that Document's document element. If these
 * returned XMLObjects are then inserted as the children of other XMLObjects, it is up to the caller to ensure that the
 * XMLObject tree is then remarshalled if the relationship of the cached DOM nodes is important (e.g. resolution of
 * ID-typed attributes via {@link Document#getElementById(String)}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For some use cases where the returned XMLObjects will not necessarily be stored back as children of another parent
 * XMLObject, it may still necessary for the DOM Elements of the resultant XMLObjects to exist within the tree of Nodes
 * rooted at a DOM Document's document element (e.g. signature verification on the standalone decrypted XMLObject). For
 * these cases these method variants may be used: {@link #decryptDataToList(EncryptedData, boolean)} and
 * {@link #decryptData(EncryptedData, boolean)}.  The <code>rootInNewDocument</code> parameter is explained below.
 * A default value for this parameter, for the overloaded convenience methods
 * which do not take this parameter explicitly, may be set via {@link #setRootInNewDocument(boolean)}.
 * This default value is initialized to <code>false</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>If the boolean option <code>rootInNewDocument</code> is true at the time of decryption,
 * then for each top-level child Element of the decrypted DocumentFragment, the following will occur:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>A new DOM Document will be created.</li>
 * <li>The Element will be adopted into that Document.</li>
 * <li>The Element will be made the root element of the Document.</li>
 * <li>The Element will be unmarshalled into an XMLObject as in the single argument variant.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that new Document creation, node adoption and rooting the new document element are potentially very expensive.
 * This should only be done where the caller's use case really requires it.
 * </p>
